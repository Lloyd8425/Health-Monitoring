**Introduction:**
	
In today’s society everyone is concerned with living a long and healthy lifestyle.
Sometimes this can be very difficult, mainly because we are not committed in doing what it takes to make it happen.
Living a long and healthy life means eating right and exercising on a regular basis.
Nothing in this world is for free, you have to put in the effort and you will see the results.
	
This Application for monitoring your health is just one aspect of showing your dedication and commitment.
Hopefully with tracking your results and seeing progress will motivate you more into wanting to maintain this type of a lifestyle. 
The basic foundation for this application will allow its users to input and track the following.
	
**Application Data List:**
	
+ First name / Last name
+ Initial Weight
+ Height
+ Age
+ Blood pressure
+ Exercise completed 
+ Start time
+ End time
+ Meals…vegetables, fruits, fiber etc.
+ Calories (optional)
+ Cholesterol

**Correspondence:**
      
Users would be able to track certain activities on a daily basis like the type of exercise they did and for how long.
If they desire, they could record their pulse after exercise to ensure they not doing too much or too little.
Users could track weekly intake of caffeine, fruits, proteins and so on.
Users don’t necessarily have to record blood pressure daily unless there was a significant issue there i.e., consistent hypertensions.
Users at any given moment could retrieve their data input and view their progress.
This would be an indicator if their plan / routines are working as planned.
Users could change routine as desired in-order for better results.
Users can check their weight on a weekly basis to verify a change from their initial reading.

Data breech has always been a concern in in this new technological age that we live in.
With this application a general user must only be able to see their information inputted.
So essentially there might be a need for each user profile to have some form of security encryption.
An administrator for sure could view / monitor every profile of misuse etc.
I know it don’t seem like much of a risk, but an intruder can utilize personal information for their personal gain or even sell this information to a third party.
If a hacker can monitor your daily routines, then you the user could be very vulnerable.
Administrator have to right to block / delete account if users violate terms and conditions. 
Users have the ability to leave feedback as well as messaging admin with any bugs found within program.
